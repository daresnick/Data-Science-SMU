This **Case Study** is a solution of various coding problems mainly in **R** with a touch of **SAS** and **Python**.  The solution is provided in the **report.Rmd** file and displays well on Github in the **report.md** file.  


The questions are included in the report.md file and include a question about outputing a matrix in **SAS**, **R**, and **Python**, a time series analysis involving the stock price of ADP in the last 16 years, a detailed analysis about the growth of trees in the built-in data set **Orange** in **R**, and an analysis of average temperatures in major countries and cities around the globe over the last 16 years.  


The **report.Rmd** file was made using **RStudio** and includes an **RMarkdown** file that should run all the code and display all the figures if knitted in **RStudio**.  The data used is found in the **Data** folder and all the code is also available and can be run from the **analysis.R** file in the **Analysis** folder.  External images can be found in the ExternalFigures folder.


Both authors would like to thank the instructor and TA's for the **SMU** Doing Data Science masters program class.
